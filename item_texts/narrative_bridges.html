<!-- ?? Ancient Basin -->
<p class="ancient-basin-historical-text">
The origins of the symbolism and aesthetic of Hallownest can be traced all the way back to the Hadriatic period, 
where grand structures such as the Pantheon, which has a marvellous marble interior, 
and the use of Corinthian columns in temples like the Temple of Hadrian. 
Though the ancient civilisation of ‘void’ has disappeared, 
their remains along with those of many other tribes show the rich and 
multifaceted history of Hallownest far beyond its kingdomhood.
</p>

<p class="ancient-basin-hollow-knight-text">
As the Knight ventures deeper into Hallownest, they begin to uncover details that few travellers 
in Hallownest have encountered, with details that are “so scant”. Once the home of the Pale King, 
his palace has disappeared as a consequence of the Infection, 
and all that remains are the elegant, yet decadent structures of an ancient city.
