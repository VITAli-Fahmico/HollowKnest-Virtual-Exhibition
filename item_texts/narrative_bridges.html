<!-- ?? Dirtmouth -->
<p class="dirtmouth-historical-text"> 
In 18th-century Italy, the Enlightenment and Reform Era emphasized reason, progress, and public welfare—values seen in civic architecture like wells and aqueducts. This rational approach to design subtly echoes in Hollow Knight’s Dirtmouth, where remnants of past purpose lie quietly beneath decay.
</p>

<p class="dirtmouth-hollow-knight-text">
Our journey begins in Dirtmouth, a crumbling town perched above the ruins of Hallownest. Silent and desolate, it stands as the player’s first step into the unknown. What lies below is a descent into memory, ruin, and the strange beauty of what was left behind.
</p>

<!-- ?? Forgotten Crossroads -->
<p class="forgotten-crossroads-historical-text">
During the Middle Ages, the rise of pilgrimages shaped a culture of travel, devotion, and symbolic tokens like badges. These reflected spiritual commitment and movement across Europe. This atmosphere subtly shapes Hollow Knight’s Forgotten Crossroads, where faded paths hint at journeys long past.
</p>

<p class="forgotten-crossroads-hollow-knight-text">
Having descended from the quiet surface of Dirtmouth, the Knight enters the Forgotten Crossroads—a network of broken paths once filled with life and pilgrimage. Echoes of old faith remain in the worn statues and silent gates, each whispering of the many who came before.
</p>

<!-- ?? Greenpath -->
<p class="greenpath-historical-text">
It turns out that Team Cherry may not have only taken inspiration from great pieces of architecture and aesthetics shown in them, 
but also important historical objects that played a vital part in the survival of humanity.
</p>

<p class="greenpath-hollow-knight-text">
After navigating the Forgotten Crossroads, the Knight finally makes way through Greenpath. However, they are only able to make it 
so far until they confront a skilled protector of what lies beyond the area.
</p>

<!-- ?? Fungal Wastes -->
<p class="fungal-wastes-historical-text">
In Japan’s Edo period, a time of peace and cultural flourishing, Noh theatre thrived as a refined art form supported by the samurai elite. Its masks embodied restraint, ambiguity, and shifting identity. This aesthetic subtly echoes through Hollow Knight’s Fungal Wastes, where still faces watch in silence.
</p>

<p class="fungal-wastes-hollow-knight-text">
Leaving behind the tangled dangers of Greenpath, the Knight ventures into the shadowy Fungal Wastes, where appearances deceive and hidden faces—like the Noh masks—reflect the many roles and stories waiting to be uncovered.
</p>

<!-- ?? City of Tears (L) -->
<p class="city-of-tears-left-historical-text">
Following the emergence of the neo-Gothic aesthetic found in many Hollow Knight areas, the French Artnoveau movement becomes apparent in many designs seen in the City of Tears. This evokes the atmosphere of Paris’s saloons with not only the Artnoveau architecture, but also the atmosphere with certain details like the rain.
</p>

<p class="city-of-tears-left-hollow-knight-text">
After the Knight defeats the Mantis Lords in combat and yet still fails to find out what is behind the masks of the Mantis Lords, the Knight finds safe passage in Mantis Village, unlocking new abilities that allow them to enter the City Tears shows some beautiful architecture.
</p>

<!-- ?? Crystal Peak -->
<p class="crystal-peak-historical-text">
The influence of Mediterranean architecture continues beyond the grand designs of the Ancient Basin, sharing the history of Crystal peak in trivial details while also being crucial to the formation of the structures that allowed it to be a mining centre in Hallownest for a long time.
</p>

<p class="crystal-peak-hollow-knight-text">
After finding themselves in an ornate, decorated city, the Knight sees the simplicity of beautiful designs and the history of Crystal Peak embedded into small pieces of architecture. 
</p>

<!-- ?? Resting Grounds -->
<p class="resting-grounds-historical-text">
The influence of special symbols in Hollow Knight is not limited merely to material items, but also artistic movements that had a profound impact on the game’s design and symbolism.
</p>

<p class="resting-grounds-hollow-knight-text">
When curiously wandering around the Crystal Peak, the Knight decides to fall down a random chasm. They end up in an unknown place that ends up being a dream. It is at that point when the Knight is truly disillusioned with their surrealist reality.
</p>

<!-- ?? Howling Cliffs -->
<p class="howling-cliffs-historical-text">
Succeeding the revival movements of many artforms, the accordion is a fine example of a revolutionised piece of history and culture thanks to 20th century developments. The town Castelfidardo in Italy, known as the accordion capital of the world gave rise to two fine accordionists that played a crucial role in both manufacturing and performing the instrument. 
</p>

<p class="howling-cliffs-hollow-knight-text">
When wandering around the Howling Cliffs, the Knight confronts "the corpse of a large bug", and can’t help but to interact with it with their newly acquired Dream Nail. After some exploration around Hallownest, they decide to engage in a mysterious ritual and encounter a mysterious member of a group that wields red, torchlike sticks and plays Italian-sounding accordion melodies.
</p>

<!-- ?? Fog Canyon -->
<p class="fog-canyon-historical-text">
From the 13th century onward, Zen Buddhism profoundly shaped Japanese aesthetics, promoting simplicity, impermanence, and introspection. These ideals appear in narrative handscrolls, where quiet scenes unfold gradually like moments in meditation. Hollow Knight’s Fog Canyon reflects this mindset—misty, dreamlike, and layered with hidden meaning.
</p>

<p class="fog-canyon-hollow-knight-text">
Emerging from the echoes of distant melodies in Howling Cliffs, the Knight ventures into the misty Fog Canyon, where the Teacher’s Archive safeguards ancient knowledge—its dream-locked secrets unfolding much like the delicate scenes of a handscroll.
</p>

<!-- ?? City of Tears (R) -->
<p class="city-of-tears-right-historical-text">
Art Nouveau in Russia (more commonly known as “modern”) emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influenced by European styles, but adapted to Russian tastes and architecture. Muyaki’s elevator reflects this legacy through being symbolic of progress, luxury, and modern aesthetics, closely resembling the large elevator in the City of Tears in many respects.
</p>

<p class="city-of-tears-right-hollow-knight-text">
After exploring much of the natural terrain of Hallownest, the Knight descends a luxurious elevator back into the City of Tears. This time, however, they find themselves in the eastern part of the city where Hallownest’s high society lived. The eastern side features posh, luxurious interiors with a red and purple colour pattern, making the contrast between the more plain west side apparent as the Knight discovers the history of a divided city.
</p>

<!-- ?? Deepnest -->
<p class="deepnest-historical-text">
In 2009, the East African Community expanded to include Burundi and Rwanda, marking a step toward regional integration. This period emphasized collaboration and cultural identity. The golden spider silk shawl, woven in Madagascar, reflects this spirit of unity and craftsmanship.
</p>

<p class="deepnest-hollow-knight-text">
After leaving the grandeur of the City of Tears’ high society behind, the Knight ventures deeper into the shadowed, tangled corridors of Deepnest. Here, in the quiet darkness, ancient methods of preservation and care echo in the strange relics and winding passages the Knight must navigate.
</p>

<!-- ?? Royal Waterways -->
<p class="royal-waterways-historical-text">
The desire to revive Gothic and Medieval architecture in England intended to complement or even supersede the neoclassical styles prevalent at the time, drawing from features of medieval examples, such as decorative patterns, finials, lancet windows and hood moulds. Even if only responsible for small parts, it was responsible for the composition of many grand structures in England, inspiring Team Cherry to create a similar intricate aesthetic in the Royal Waterways.
</p>

<p class="royal-waterways-hollow-knight-text">
After navigating the dark labyrinths of Deepnest, the pipes and tunnels in the Royal Waterways show the elegant patterns of a decadent Gothic-inspired aesthetic, with some acid pools and overgrowth, but most importantly, mounds of trash. Amongst all of this, there lies incredible abilities to swim through even the most acidic water, and a golden sarcophagus in large piles of trash leading to the home of gods.
</p>

<!-- ?? Ancient Basin -->
<p class="ancient-basin-historical-text">
The origins of the symbolism and aesthetic of Hallownest can be traced all the way back to the Hadriatic period, 
where grand structures such as the Pantheon, which has a marvellous marble interior, 
and the use of Corinthian columns in temples like the Temple of Hadrian. 
Though the ancient civilisation of ‘void’ has disappeared, 
their remains along with those of many other tribes show the rich and 
multifaceted history of Hallownest far beyond its kingdomhood.
</p>

<p class="ancient-basin-hollow-knight-text">
As the Knight ventures deeper into Hallownest, they begin to uncover details that few travellers 
in Hallownest have encountered, with details that are “so scant”. Once the home of the Pale King, 
his palace has disappeared as a consequence of the Infection, 
and all that remains are the elegant, yet decadent structures of an ancient city.
</p>

<!-- ?? Kingdom's Edge -->
<p class="kingdoms-edge-historical-text">
From the 1500s onward in Italy, skulls replaced skeletons as the dominant symbol of death in memento mori art. This shift reflected evolving attitudes toward mortality during and after the Renaissance. Such imagery resonates with the themes of identity and decay in Hollow Knight’s Kingdom’s Edge.
</p>

<p class="kingdoms-edge-hollow-knight-text">
Having explored the fading splendor of the Pale King’s vanished palace, the Knight moves onward into Kingdom’s Edge, a place marked by ruins and echoes of lives lost. Here, the theme of transformation is starkly present, as bodies and memories decay and reshape, mirroring the Knight’s own shifting existence.
</p>

<!-- ?? The Hive-->
<p class="the-hive-historical-text">
Developed in early 20th-century France, Abbé Warré’s hive promoted sustainable, communal beekeeping. By 1948, amid growing labor unrest like the French Miners’ Strike, ideas of cooperative structures gained renewed urgency. This ethos of resilience and organized collectivity echoes in Hollow Knight’s Hive, both shelter and system.
</p>

<p class="the-hive-hollow-knight-text">
From the solemn ruins of Kingdom’s Edge, the Knight journeys into The Hive, a living network of tunnels and chambers buzzing with activity. Just as Warré’s hive brings together countless bees in an organized, thriving community, The Hive’s architecture mirrors this intricate structure, with chairs and shelves fashioned in ways that echo the natural harmony and cooperation found in the bee colony.
</p>

<!-- ?? Queen's Gardens -->
<p class="queens-gardens-historical-text">
Another interesting use of the Gothic Revival style can be seen in its emergence  in the United States, used for the construction of new churches and universities. This style incorporates elements of medieval Gothic architecture with wood carpentry, a prevalent practice in rural America at the time, inspiring the architectural design of the “Queen’s Gardens” in Hollow Knight.
</p>

<p class="queens-gardens-hollow-knight-text">
After navigating the depths of Hallownest, the Knight finds themself in a lush area, featuring ornate gates and structures, but also vicious bugs and plants that have grown wild. They also discover tent-like structures and chambers that house insiders and outsiders alike in the area, making use of the area’s structures.
