<!-- ?? Dirtmouth -->
<p class="dirtmouth-historical-text"> 
    In 18th-century Italy, the Enlightenment and Reform Era emphasized reason, progress, and public welfare—values seen in civic architecture like wells and aqueducts. This rational approach to design subtly echoes in Hollow Knight’s Dirtmouth, where remnants of past purpose lie quietly beneath decay.
</p>

<p class="dirtmouth-hollow-knight-text">
    Our journey begins in Dirtmouth, a crumbling town perched above the ruins of Hallownest. Silent and desolate, it stands as the player’s first step into the unknown. What lies below is a descent into memory, ruin, and the strange beauty of what was left behind.
</p>

<!-- ?? Forgotten Crossroads -->
<p class="forgotten-crossroads-historical-text">
    During the Middle Ages, the rise of pilgrimages shaped a culture of travel, devotion, and symbolic tokens like badges. These reflected spiritual commitment and movement across Europe. This atmosphere subtly shapes Hollow Knight’s Forgotten Crossroads, where faded paths hint at journeys long past.
</p>

<p class="forgotten-crossroads-hollow-knight-text">
    Having descended from the quiet surface of Dirtmouth, the Knight enters the Forgotten Crossroads—a network of broken paths once filled with life and pilgrimage. Echoes of old faith remain in the worn statues and silent gates, each whispering of the many who came before.
</p>

<!-- ?? Greenpath -->
<p class="greenpath-historical-text">
It turns out that Team Cherry may not have only taken inspiration from great pieces of architecture and aesthetics shown in them, 
but also important historical objects that played a vital part in the survival of humanity.
</p>

<p class="greenpath-hollow-knight-text">
After navigating the Forgotten Crossroads, the Knight finally makes way through Greenpath. However, they are only able to make it 
so far until they confront a skilled protector of what lies beyond the area.
</p>

<!-- ?? Fungal Wastes -->
<p class="fungal-wastes-historical-text">
    In Japan’s Edo period, a time of peace and cultural flourishing, Noh theatre thrived as a refined art form supported by the samurai elite. Its masks embodied restraint, ambiguity, and shifting identity. This aesthetic subtly echoes through Hollow Knight’s Fungal Wastes, where still faces watch in silence.
</p>

<p class="fungal-wastes-hollow-knight-text">
    Leaving behind the tangled dangers of Greenpath, the Knight ventures into the shadowy Fungal Wastes, where appearances deceive and hidden faces—like the Noh masks—reflect the many roles and stories waiting to be uncovered.

<!-- ?? Fog Canyon -->
<p class="fog-canyon-historical-text">
    From the 13th century onward, Zen Buddhism profoundly shaped Japanese aesthetics, promoting simplicity, impermanence, and introspection. These ideals appear in narrative handscrolls, where quiet scenes unfold gradually like moments in meditation. Hollow Knight’s Fog Canyon reflects this mindset—misty, dreamlike, and layered with hidden meaning.
</p>

<p class="fog-canyon-hollow-knight-text">
    Emerging from the echoes of distant melodies in Howling Cliffs, the Knight ventures into the misty Fog Canyon, where the Teacher’s Archive safeguards ancient knowledge—its dream-locked secrets unfolding much like the delicate scenes of a handscroll.

<!-- ?? Deepnest -->
<p class="deepnest-historical-text">
    In 2009, the East African Community expanded to include Burundi and Rwanda, marking a step toward regional integration. This period emphasized collaboration and cultural identity. The golden spider silk shawl, woven in Madagascar, reflects this spirit of unity and craftsmanship.
</p>

<p class="deepnest-hollow-knight-text">
    After leaving the grandeur of the City of Tears’ high society behind, the Knight ventures deeper into the shadowed, tangled corridors of Deepnest. Here, in the quiet darkness, ancient methods of preservation and care echo in the strange relics and winding passages the Knight must navigate.

<!-- ?? Ancient Basin -->
<p class="ancient-basin-historical-text">
The origins of the symbolism and aesthetic of Hallownest can be traced all the way back to the Hadriatic period, 
where grand structures such as the Pantheon, which has a marvellous marble interior, 
and the use of Corinthian columns in temples like the Temple of Hadrian. 
Though the ancient civilisation of ‘void’ has disappeared, 
their remains along with those of many other tribes show the rich and 
multifaceted history of Hallownest far beyond its kingdomhood.
</p>

<p class="ancient-basin-hollow-knight-text">
As the Knight ventures deeper into Hallownest, they begin to uncover details that few travellers 
in Hallownest have encountered, with details that are “so scant”. Once the home of the Pale King, 
his palace has disappeared as a consequence of the Infection, 
and all that remains are the elegant, yet decadent structures of an ancient city.
</p>

<!-- ?? Kingdom's Edge -->
<p class="kingdoms-edge-historical-text">
    From the 1500s onward in Italy, skulls replaced skeletons as the dominant symbol of death in memento mori art. This shift reflected evolving attitudes toward mortality during and after the Renaissance. Such imagery resonates with the themes of identity and decay in Hollow Knight’s Kingdom’s Edge.
</p>

<p class="kingdoms-edge-hollow-knight-text">
    Having explored the fading splendor of the Pale King’s vanished palace, the Knight moves onward into Kingdom’s Edge, a place marked by ruins and echoes of lives lost. Here, the theme of transformation is starkly present, as bodies and memories decay and reshape, mirroring the Knight’s own shifting existence.
</p>

<!-- ?? The Hive-->
<p class="the-hive-historical-text">
    Developed in early 20th-century France, Abbé Warré’s hive promoted sustainable, communal beekeeping. By 1948, amid growing labor unrest like the French Miners’ Strike, ideas of cooperative structures gained renewed urgency. This ethos of resilience and organized collectivity echoes in Hollow Knight’s Hive, both shelter and system.
</p>

<p class="the-hive-hollow-knight-text">
    From the solemn ruins of Kingdom’s Edge, the Knight journeys into The Hive, a living network of tunnels and chambers buzzing with activity. Just as Warré’s hive brings together countless bees in an organized, thriving community, The Hive’s architecture mirrors this intricate structure, with chairs and shelves fashioned in ways that echo the natural harmony and cooperation found in the bee colony.
