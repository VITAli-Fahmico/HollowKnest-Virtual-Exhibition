The item featured here is a limestone architectural element from the early Byzantine period. Originating from ancient Egypt, it is associated with Coptic culture, exemplifying the vine rinceau motif, sometimes referred to as a scroll. This is a motif that is abstracted across Hallownest, particularly in Crystal peaks where they are evident even in small details such as lanterns.

The vine rinceau motif featured in the item features a stylised decorative design made up of flowing, curved plant vines, that was prevalent in the eastern Mediterranean from the Roman period onwards. Sometimes, animals are incorporated into these designs—in this case, there are wolves and gazelles. In Crystal Peak, the vine rinceau motif depicts stylised carvings of bug-like figures, but it is also used as an important aesthetic and architectural foundation in important features like ore conveyor belts that reflect the history and activity of the area. Beyond being featured in Crystal Peak, abstractions of decorative friezes are evident in the user interface aesthetic, especially the styling that is used to introduce each new area to the Knight.

Beyond simple artefacts, the use of the rinceaux form can be frequently seen in the friezes of Roman buildings, or as decorative elements in Romanesque structures and Renaissance buildings. The motif experienced a revival in the 17th and 18th century in a more simple classical style, applied more freely without the strict repetition of identical forms, resembling more of those featured in larger rinceau designs in Hollow Knight. The image with the palace structure illustrates the more free form here where rinceau-inspired elements—curved lines and organic forms—especially in the railings and the supporting arches, applying them freely without strict repetition and symmetry, demonstrating the motif’s use in a more free form that is atmospheric and expressive in nature.
