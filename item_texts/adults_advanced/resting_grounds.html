Paul Klee’s artwork ‘Ships in the Dark’ is an artwork that depicts stylised, abstract boats seemingly floating in a dreamlike sky, sailing through the air with no clear sense of direction, serving as a visual metaphor for the surreal journey of the Knight. Such surrealist themes become very evident once the Knight acquires the Dream Nail in the Resting Grounds, which allows them to see the inner thoughts of characters, effectively blurring the distinction between reality and the dream world in Hallownest.

Both the painting and the game invite symbolic interpretation without offering direct answers, as meaning is emergent, not imposed. The focus here is about how the artform attempts to communicate its meaning as opposed to ‘what’ or ‘why’. The boats in Klee’s artwork are flying and seeking something, though it is very ambiguous what this is. Similarly, the Knight struggles to identify the true cause of the infection and who they truly are. Klee’s work evokes a quiet sadness through a solitary drift of boats through space. ‘Ships in the Dark’ captures this tone, and so does the Resting Grounds with its hollow ruins, soft music, and lack of creatures.

Another important characteristic of surrealism demonstrated in both situations is the repetition of a certain object or theme many times to maximise and enforce a particular feeling, maintaining the importance of dreams. Ships in Klee’s artwork are repeated to emphasise unique qualities of each ship and their juxtaposition with each other within the context of the artwork including their colour, size, and shape. Similarly, as the Knight journeys through the Resting Grounds, dreams are reinforced through a descent into the unknown in addition to the prevalence of Essence. This reveals a core principle behind the aesthetic goals of Hollow Knight: actions can be interpreted and cues can be taken from them, allowing the game to thrive on the unknown and clearly showcase many presentational aspects of the game.
