This decorative oak panel exemplifies the design of Augustus Pugin, considered the leading proponent of the Gothic Revival style in England. His work is central to the transformation in British design that commenced in the mid-nineteenth century. The influence of such an aesthetic is very evident in the design of the many solid surfaces in the Royal Waterways, such as floors, pylons, and ceilings.

Carved oak panels like these are just one component of a larger Pugin-designed interior program for the Palace of Westminster. Panels like this are executed in Pugin’s interpretation of the Gothic revival, featuring various different patterns influenced by medieval tracery and linen fold patterns. As such, it is clear that the design of the Royal Waterways draws from such a ‘royal’ Gothic aesthetic, unique to itself, especially with the surface design of the area. Each segment features a central, petal-like or mandible-like form bordered by smaller, mirrored shapes, creating the appearance of an organic shape stylised into ornamentation, blending nature with a constructed aesthetic just like Pugin’s oak panel.

The panel reflects the broader ideals of the Gothic Revival: moral clarity, structured beauty, and reverence for medieval craftsmanship. In his philosophies, Pugin demanded honesty in the materials employed and the design chosen, creating a link between said beauty and moral purpose. The Royal Waterways echoes this aesthetic as a whole, though in a decayed and subterranean form. The carved stone surfaces bear repeated motifs that mirror the controlled naturalism of Gothic Revival design. Furthermore, the vaulted ceilings and griddled floors, hinting at the sanctity of the once ‘royal’ place, corrupted by time and the infestation. As with Pugin’s panel, such forms encapsulate Hallownest as a city where its structure upheld order, but is now fractured yet still recognisable in its ornamentation. Even in this state of ruin, the Waterways still retain a sense of dark majesty rooted in the same Gothic tendency to transform nature into structured designs.
