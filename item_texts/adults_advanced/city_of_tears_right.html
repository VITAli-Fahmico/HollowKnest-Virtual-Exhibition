The steam-powered elevator featured is one in the house of the Guard Captain of S. Muyaki in St. Petersberg, Russia. It is close to the entrance of the complex to deliver residents directly to their apartment rooms. Similarly, in Hollow Knight, the Knight uses an ornate elevator between the grand City of Tears and the Forgotten Crossroads, bringing together distant social and spatial environments.

Muyaki’s elevator embodies the aesthetic transition into the Art Nouveau movement in the early 1900s, featuring a fusion of decorations from the period with raw industrial materials such as valuable wood species, carvings and incrustrations and visible machinery (i.e. gears, pipes, pistons). This combination reflects the steampunk aesthetic, a romantic fusion of Victorian elegance and steam-age mechanics. Both elevators exhibit ornate wrought iron patterns, elegant symmetry, and domed roofs, transporting their residents through enclosed cabins in elevator shafts that are decorated with unique ornamentation. While the contemporary users of Muyaki’s elevator may vary, the Knight is the only contemporary user of the elevator between the vastly different areas, reflecting the luxury and sophistication in the fallen capital of Hallownest (i.e. the City of Tears) that they bear witness to.

Both elevators act as status symbols, marking transitions between social and spatial realms, emphasising technological sophistication and elegance within a small environment. Muyaki’s elevator today is used very sparingly–requiring annual tests rather than daily usage, and the City of Tears’ lift also feels like a rare, almost ceremonial passageway only used by the Knight, forming an important part of the fallen Kingdom of Hallownest once built on status and order. Furthermore, both elevators serve as portals in a literal and a metaphorical sense. Muyaki’s carriage delivered residents into their private apartment rooms, while the Knight’s elevator bridges together the grandeur of the City of Tears and the Forgotten Crossroads. This serves as a provocation to consider not only how the residents of their respective environments moved through space, but also how such movement defines social hierarchies, cultural values, and the passage of time.
