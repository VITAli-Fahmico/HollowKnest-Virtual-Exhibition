Built by accordionist Giovanni Marcosignori, this accordion is the first accordion with a celluloid exterior and is one of the most significant and valuable instruments in the Museo Della Fisarmonica. Drawing on the concept of a more refined, vintage finish, Brumm’s accordion not only models the texture but also the musical aesthetic of early 20th century Italian accordions. The music played is a consequence of the Knight lighting the abandoned Nightmare Lantern in the Howling Cliffs.

Under the guidance of his father Giovanni—an accordion lover, Gervasio Marcosignori began studying the instrument at a very young age. In the Gervasio Marcosignori room in the Museo Della Fisarmonica, the legacies of Giovanni as a pioneer of the modern accordion and Gervasio as a revolutionary performer are both reflected here. Inspired by a vintage sounding accordion like this one, Brumm’s accordion music features a carnival-esque, slightly eerie melody, and is vintage and theatrical in its feel, depicting the eerie nature of the Grimm Troupe. This is further reinforced by the celluloid texture of Giovanni Marcosignori’s accordion that is modelled by the texture of a bug in Brumm’s accordion, but additionally features limbs, implying that the accordion is a dead or alive bug.

The celluloid accordion is indicative of the great legacy of Gervasio Marcosignori, who continued the passion of his father. He was awarded the “Oscar Mondiale della Fisarmonica” for his prolific activity as one of the main pioneers of arranging and performing accordion music (including but not limited to the works of many musicians such as Bach and Gershwin), dedicating his life to the study and international spread of the instrument. Akin to the compositions of Marcosignori, Brumm’s music seems to bear resemblance to Troupe Master Grimm’s theme; however, it seems to serve as an important juxtaposition against the predominantly orchestral and ambient compositions. In the Howling Cliffs, the Knight makes an important choice whether to allow or not allow the Grimm Troupe into Hallownest; reflecting both a great heritage of expressive performance and a moment of tension in the Knight’s journey in Hallownest when introduced to this aesthetic.
