“Faith and Hope” is a double lancet by artist Henry E. Sharp, coming from St. Ann's Church in Brooklyn, New York, USA, depicting two full‑figure personifications: Faith, typically holding a cross or symbol, and Hope, often featuring an anchor. Though the religious designs are sometimes taken out of the Gothic-inspired windows in the windows in the Queen’s Gardens images above, the fundamental design retained as an integral part of establishing the Gothic Revival character of the architectural parts of the area that bear resemblance to Sharp’s work.

Sharp’s window exemplifies the characteristics of Gothic Revival stained glass windows. Each figure in the window is set beneath an elaborate trefoil arch, surrounded in stained glass with strong red, blue, and yellow colouring. The style is clearly medieval inspired, featuring pointed arches and ornamental canopies that echo Gothic church windows, while the high craftsmanship is evident in the delicate lead design, copper foil, and paint. Blending together natural aesthetics with character and the grand structures, the ornate windows of the Queen’s Gardens in Hollow Knight borrows more from neo-Gothic characteristics rather than traditional ones, maintaining the ornate nature of the area as the “Queen’s Gardens” and focusing less on the decadent aesthetic found in other parts of Hallownest. Form is crucial here, being one of the key characteristics that was drawn from designs like Sharp in the Queen’s Gardens, including pointed arches, ornate tracery, framed openings, and symbolic use of light (both literal and implied).

The mid-1850s saw the growth of a stained-glass industry around Manhattan’s Broadway, in part because numerous churches were being built in New York during the period, requiring the industry’s services. Glass stainers like Sharp joined the movement, providing “Faith and Hope”, alongside several other windows for St Ann’s Episcopal Church, a grand Gothic revival structure, featuring richly coloured windows that were typical of the period. While “Faith and Hope” and the Queen’s Gardens both shed light on a contemporaneous emerging aesthetic, the environmental storytelling of the Gardens reveal the narrative of the Infection through the architecture and ruin of the area. Once an area known to be the Queen of Hallownest’s retreating location, the Knight sees the Queen’s Gardens as an area crowded with overgrown vegetation and thorny vines, yet the elegance of the neglected greenhouses remains through the everlasting designs remains, notably through the ornate windows.
