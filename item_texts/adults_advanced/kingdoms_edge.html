    This Renaissance-era memento mori confronts viewers with a haunting duality: a woman shown part-living, part-dead, suspended between two states of being. It is a meditation on identity, decay, and the passage of time. In Hollow Knight, the Pale King experiences a similar rupture—relinquishing his immense Wyrm form to become something smaller and more fallible. Kingdom’s Edge, littered with the remains of fallen champions outside the Colosseum of Fools, visualizes this ongoing process of loss. Like the memento, these figures exist in tension between what they were and what remains.

    This evocative Renaissance memento mori presents a woman whose face is split in two—one side alive, the other reduced to skull. It is a visual confrontation with mortality and transformation, capturing the instability of identity when life yields to time. Hollow Knight stages similar transitions in Kingdom’s Edge, where change is a slow erosion. The Pale King, once a vast Wyrm, discards his towering form to become something smaller, more mortal—an echo of the divided self. Nearby, the Colosseum of Fools empties its slain fighters into the canyon below, leaving their bones to pile like forgotten memories. These scenes, like the object, invite reflection on how form, identity, and legacy persist or vanish in the face of death’s quiet erosion. What survives—body, echo, or idea—is never entirely clear.
