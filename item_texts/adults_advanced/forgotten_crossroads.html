    This lead pilgrim badge once marked its wearer as a devout traveler. In Hollow Knight, the Forgotten Crossroads echo such pilgrimages—not only through the presence of the Pilgrim’s Gate, whose pointed arch mirrors the badge, but in the Knight’s silent journey through a landscape haunted by religious decay, ancestral echoes, and a kingdom hollowed by forgotten belief.

    Pilgrim badges were mass-produced in medieval Europe, worn by those returning from sacred journeys. Their function was twofold: a mark of spiritual accomplishment and a physical token of the path taken. In Hollow Knight, the Forgotten Crossroads serve as a spiritual scar, filled with memorials to a civilization shaped by devotion and loss. The Pilgrim’s Gate - positioned near the descent into the Temple of the Black Egg - resembles the badge in form and function. It acts as a fixed threshold between surface and sanctum, while the Knight moves as a mobile echo of those who once walked these consecrated paths. In Hallownest, pilgrimage becomes repetition: cycles of arrival, abandonment, and rediscovery.

    This medieval pilgrim badge, likely from 14th-century England, was sewn onto clothing to identify someone who had completed a sacred journey. Often depicting saints or holy symbols, these badges were both mass-produced devotional tokens and physical affirmations of one’s spiritual path. In Hollow Knight, the Forgotten Crossroads and the Pilgrim’s Gate reflect a kingdom once rich in ritualized movement. The gate’s gothic arch - both in design and narrative placement - invokes a visual and thematic parallel with the badge: each marks a transition between ordinary space and sacred trial. Beneath the gate lies the path to the Temple of the Black Egg, itself a religious relic central to Hallownest’s failed salvation myth. As the Knight crosses the gate and traverses the crossroads, they participate in a pilgrimage not toward salvation but into the memory of one - an echo of rituals repeated long after their meaning was lost. The badge becomes a mirror: just as pilgrims wore it outwardly, the Knight bears the weight of a forgotten spiritual inheritance inwardly, retracing ancient steps toward a divine silence.
