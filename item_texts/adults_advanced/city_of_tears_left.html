This is a special rectangular balcony front from Paris, made around 1900, decorated with curling scrolls that are interlocked with curling tendrils that have motifs that are floral and vegetal in nature, akin to what is seen in the picture of the Knight wondering through the City of Tears. This is based on the Artnouveau aesthetic from France, which was a clear source of inspiration for many designs in Hollow Knight.

The balcony front is one of many of designer and architect Hector Guimard’s significant works that demonstrate his role as a leading exponent of the Art Nouveau style. Strongly influenced by one of the most famous founders of the movement Victor Horta, Guimard drew on the curving stylised vegetal forms employed by Horta in his works, not only influencing Guimard, but many other artists. Team Cherry’s designers evidently drew on such aesthetics, as evident not only in much of the aesthetic of the City of Tears based on Guimard's work, but also as part of the overall architectural aesthetic of Hallownest.

While Guimard’s best known works are the Castel Beranger (1894-1898) and the Paris metro entrances, his design of future and interior fittings may have also inspired the design of the City of Tears. Such influence is not only apparent in simple yet elegant designs like in the balcony front, but also in Guimard’s other works, including the first Art Nouveau apartment that he designed in Paris and the well-known Paris metro entrances. Beyond being pleasant, the art style functions to construct the overall atmosphere of the City of Tears, but most notably, the architectural aesthetic inspired not only by his balcony front, but also by metro station entrances. A notable example of the latter is that of Porte Dauphine where the influence can be seen in the nearby City Storerooms stag station in both the entrance design and the balcony-like panels resembling Guimard’s. In particular, elements including the wallpapers, curtains, the perfume bottle-shaped objects that exist throughout the area coalesce to form a Baudelariean atmosphere, evoking Hallownest as a once-grand, melancholic kingdom that has faded away.
