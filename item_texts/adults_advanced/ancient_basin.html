As the Knight ventures deeper into Hallownest, they begin to uncover details that few travellers 
in Hallownest have encountered, with details that are “so scant”. Once the home of the Pale King, 
his palace has disappeared as a consequence of the Infection, 
and all that remains are the elegant, yet decadent structures of an ancient city.

The origins of the symbolism and aesthetic of Hallownest can be traced all the way back to the Hadriatic period, 
where grand structures such as the Pantheon, which has a marvellous marble interior, 
and the use of Corinthian columns in temples like the Temple of Hadrian. 
Though the ancient civilisation of ‘void’ has disappeared, 
their remains along with those of many other tribes show the rich and 
multifaceted history of Hallownest far beyond its kingdomhood.

This is an ancient Roman marble column with a base and capital (from 117 - 138 CE) that is 
representative of architecture of the Hadrianic period. As an ancient area, 
Ancient Basin has many old structures and roads that were formed, most notably, 
marble columns that draw from ancient Roman and Greek aesthetics. 
These columns are tall, grooved, and weathered yet still remain their elegance, 
creating a sense of age, stillness, and magnificence.

The Roman column’s capital belongs to the Roman composite order, 
featuring the Ionic order’s volutes at the top and the rows of acanthus fronds are below. 
By blending these two aesthetics in conjunction with the narrow vertical grooves running down, 
the column is made taller and more elegant. The shaft of the column is partially restored, 
but still has marks remaining, similar to the marks of the long-preserved columns of Ancient Basin, 
showing signs that the Ancient Basin is an ancient underground city 
inspired by ancient Greek and Roman architecture.

The Ancient Basin is one of the oldest and deepest parts of Hallownest, 
a location where the architecture visibly shifts from organic to more stripped back, monumental, and timeworn. 
It gives the impression that it is a place for the living and a ruin dedicated to the memory and forgotten power 
of the Pale King, the former monarch of Hallownest. The presence of the stone pillars as 
illustrated in the pictures depict a civilisation long past its prime, evoking not only age, 
but also the permanence and magnificence of the ancient monumental architecture. 
This atmosphere closely parallels the aesthetic and structural principles of Roman architecture during the 
Hadrianic period, as seen in the marble column shows an effort to balance strength with elegance. 
These same principles are echoed in Ancient Basin’s architecture, albeit interpreted through the game’s darker, 
more simple style. The tall, thin columns in the area bear resemblance to their Roman counterparts with 
their worn and cracked design and remain elegant even in spite of their ruined state.
