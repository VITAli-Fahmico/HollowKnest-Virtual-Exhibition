The syringe featured is just one of three that was recovered from the cabin of the Mary Rose—a 16th century warship, with the 
purpose of treating infections of patients onboard. Similarly, Hornet’s needle—first seen in Greenpath when the Knight fights 
her, acts as an essential means by which Hallownest is able to be cured of the Infection.

Early syringes like these did not have needles, but rather they relied on a plunger that had to be pushed out in order to apply 
medicine or treatment. Like Hornet’s needle, some of these syringes took on the form of hollow reeds, and hence it is likely that 
form and function of Hornet’s needle is likely modelled based on a urethral syringe. This is evident given the motion shown by 
Hornet’s needle when she casts/pushes out the thread inside onto an enemy without any projectile shown besides the actual content 
inside the needle (i.e. the string in this case).

Belonging to special personnel onboard the Mary Rose, these were used to treat urethral irrigations by inserting it into the 
urethra and flushing out these infections with caustic fluids such as mercury, which would effectively burn off the symptoms 
from diseases such as gonorrhoea and syphilis. Interestingly, there is an evident parallel between such a process and the role 
Hornet plays with her syringe in the final boss fight against the Hollow Knight, which is of paramount importance beyond the 
Knight’s first sighting of Hornet in Greenpath. It allows for the Knight to enter the heart of the infection by defeating the 
Radiance, who is the source of the Infection that exists within the mind of the Hollow Knight. As opposed to using substances 
like mercury, speculations have been made that Hornet herself makes the thread, and is able to do so because Herrah—her mother 
as the queen of the spider tribe—granted Hornet such powers.
