    This shawl, woven from the silk of over one million golden orb-weaver spiders, mirrors the coiled, silken relics of Deepnest in Hollow Knight. Both transform thread into quiet tools of preservation, concealment, and suspended memory.

    Woven from golden orb-weaver spider silk, this shawl represents a near-mythic fusion of craftsmanship and biological rarity. Its production involved gently extracting thread from live spiders, then winding each delicate strand around cylindrical tools before weaving. The spiraled storage process resonates with Hollow Knight’s Deepnest—especially the Distant Village—where spoon-shaped forms hang cocooned in thread. These ambiguous objects, like the shawl, suggest ritualized preservation. At Deepnest’s heart lies Herrah the Beast, one of the Dreamers, sealed in timeless sleep. Both silk and Dreamer represent containment that is both protective and haunting—threads that bind memory, silence, and legacy.

    Harvested from over one million golden orb-weaver spiders, this handwoven shawl exemplifies the labor-intensive, almost mythical art of spider silk weaving. In a process that preserved the spiders’ lives, artisans extracted the silk and coiled it onto small, tube-like tools—preserving each strand before it was woven into fabric. This coiling method offers a striking parallel to the wrapped, spoon-like forms seen in Hollow Knight’s Deepnest, particularly within the unsettling silence of Distance Village. There, silken bundles hang like preserved memories or offerings, their function left purposely ambiguous. At the center lies Herrah the Beast, a Dreamer suspended in sleep, cocooned in thread. Her body, like the silk, has been carefully encased—part memorial, part ward, part trap. In both shawl and game, thread becomes a medium of preservation and control, holding beauty, sacrifice, and the unspoken weight of what must be remembered and restrained.
