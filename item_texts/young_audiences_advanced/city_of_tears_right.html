This steam-powered elevator in St. Petersburg was built to carry people directly into their apartments. It’s beautifully designed and reminds us of the elevator in Hollow Knight that moves the Knight between the City of Tears and the Forgotten Crossroads.

Built during the early 1900s, the elevator shows off the Art Nouveau style by mixing fancy wood and decorations with machines like gears and pistons. This kind of mix is part of what we call steampunk—where old-style elegance meets the look of strong steam-powered machines. Both Muyaki’s and the Knight’s elevators have curved ironwork, detailed decorations, and feel both old and elegant. Today, Muyaki’s elevator is used rarely, while in Hollow Knight, only the Knight travels on their elevator between the rich City of Tears and the rough Forgotten Crossroads.

These elevators do more than just move people—they show off the style and class of the time. Muyaki’s elevator is used just for yearly tests now, making it feel rare and special. The same goes for the Knight’s elevator, which feels almost like a ritual as it connects two very different parts of Hallownest. These elevators don’t just take people between places—they also make us think about how people once lived, moved through their world, and what those movements said about power, beauty, and change over time.
