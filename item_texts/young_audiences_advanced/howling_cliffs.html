This unique accordion was made by Giovanni Marcosignori and is the first one to have a celluloid (plastic) exterior. Its vintage look and sound inspired the strange, old-timey music in Hollow Knight when the Knight lights the Nightmare Lantern in the Howling Cliffs.

Giovanni taught his son Gervasio to play the accordion when he was very young. Today, both are honoured in a special museum. In the game, Brumm’s accordion music is spooky and playful, a lot like old carnival music. This matches the mood of the Grimm Troupe perfectly. Brumm’s accordion even looks like a bug, complete with legs, adding to the eerie feeling.

Gervasio continued his father’s legacy and became famous for playing music on the accordion, performing both classical and modern songs. He helped share the beauty of the accordion with the world and won a major award for his work. The game reflects this legacy through Brumm’s music, which feels like a mix between Gervasio’s lively accordion tunes and the strange world of the Grimm Troupe. This music stands out from the rest of the soundtrack, adding a new layer of emotion to the Knight’s choice about whether to welcome the troupe into Hallownest.
