    This Japanese Noh mask seems to change its expression when you move around it. In Hollow Knight, the beast heads in the Fungal Wastes feel the same—they don’t move, but they seem to be watching you. Both give a strange feeling that there’s more going on under the surface.

    Noh masks, used in traditional Japanese plays, are made so that their emotions shift depending on the angle and lighting. One moment the face looks calm, the next it might seem sad or angry. This is similar to the beast heads you see in Hollow Knight’s Fungal Wastes. They sit silently, mounted on poles, but somehow seem alive—changing as you pass by. Just like the mask, they feel full of hidden emotion, hinting at deeper stories in Hallownest’s past.

    This Noh mask, from Japanese theater, is designed to show different emotions depending on how it’s lit or viewed. The mask doesn’t move, but it can still look like it’s changing—calm one moment, troubled the next. In Hollow Knight, the Fungal Wastes are filled with strange beast heads stuck on poles. They also seem to change, even though they stay still. The Knight walks past them without knowing what they mean, but they feel full of emotion—almost like memories frozen in time. Both the mask and the heads give you the sense that Hallownest, like the old mask, still holds stories and feelings even if no one is left to tell them.
