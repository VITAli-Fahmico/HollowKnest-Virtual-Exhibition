    Pilgrim badges were worn by people in medieval times to show they had visited a holy place. In Hollow Knight, the Forgotten Crossroads includes the Pilgrim’s Gate—a stone arch that looks a lot like this badge. The Knight walks a quiet, sacred path, just like real-life pilgrims once did.

    In the Middle Ages, pilgrims visited special religious places, often walking for weeks. When they arrived, they would receive a small badge to wear on their clothing as a sign of their devotion. In Hollow Knight, the Knight travels through the Forgotten Crossroads, a place full of old statues and broken paths. One key landmark is the Pilgrim’s Gate, which looks like the shape of this real badge. Both the badge and the gate mark spiritual paths—ways that people (or bugs!) follow to find something greater.

    This pilgrim badge, from the 14th or 15th century, was worn by someone who had completed a sacred journey. Pilgrims in medieval Europe traveled to holy sites and received these small, metal badges to mark their devotion. The badges were often sewn onto clothing as proof of faith and bravery. In Hollow Knight, the Knight begins their own journey through a mysterious kingdom. In the Forgotten Crossroads, they pass through the Pilgrim’s Gate—an archway that looks just like the old badges pilgrims used to wear. Both the gate and the badge are signs of spiritual passage, showing that the Knight, like a real medieval pilgrim, is walking a quiet path full of history, memory, and purpose.
