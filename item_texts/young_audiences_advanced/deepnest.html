    This shawl was woven from spider silk—just like the webs in Hollow Knight’s Deepnest, where strange objects and old memories are wrapped and hidden away.

    This golden silk shawl was made using threads from over a million golden orb-weaver spiders. Each strand was wrapped around tiny tools before being woven, showing great care and patience. In Hollow Knight, the webs in Deepnest—especially in the creepy Distant Village—feel very similar. They hide cocooned shapes and secrets. Herrah the Beast, one of the Dreamers, sleeps there too, wrapped in thread. Like the shawl, Deepnest’s silk isn’t just decoration—it holds memory, protection, and perhaps a warning.

    Woven from spider silk gathered from more than a million golden orb-weavers, this rare shawl shows how humans have used delicate threads to create something both strong and beautiful. The silk was gently drawn and wrapped around small tube-like tools before it was woven—a careful process that preserved each strand. In Hollow Knight, Deepnest is also full of silk, but it’s darker and stranger. In places like Distant Village, spoon-like objects and other shapes hang wrapped in webs, hinting at forgotten rituals or offerings. At the center, Herrah the Beast sleeps, her body sealed in silk. Like the shawl, these webs seem to preserve something important but also unsettling. They hold history, memory, and maybe even a little danger—all spun into thread that connects the past to the present.
