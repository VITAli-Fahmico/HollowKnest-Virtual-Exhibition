This limestone piece is from the early Byzantine era in Egypt and is part of Coptic culture. It shows a design called the vine rinceau, a twisting, leafy pattern. Similar swirling designs appear in Hollow Knight, especially in Crystal Peak, where they even show up in small things like lanterns.

The vine rinceau design uses flowing plant vines and was very popular in Roman times across the eastern Mediterranean. Sometimes these designs included animals—here, you can see wolves and gazelles. In Hollow Knight, similar swirling shapes appear in Crystal Peak, where they decorate carvings and ore-moving belts. These patterns aren’t just decorations—they help tell the story of what the area was used for. You can also find similar shapes in the game’s user interface, such as when the Knight enters new locations.

This rinceau style was used in Roman buildings and later came back during the Renaissance. It even returned in the 17th and 18th centuries in a simpler way, without always repeating the same shapes. That’s also how the design works in Hollow Knight. In one of the palace areas, curved lines and vine-like patterns appear in railings and arches. These details, which don’t follow perfect patterns, help give Hallownest its mysterious and expressive atmosphere.
