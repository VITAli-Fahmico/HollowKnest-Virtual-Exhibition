This syringe comes from the Mary Rose, a ship that sank over 400 years ago. It was used to treat infections in the sailors onboard. Hornet’s needle in Hollow Knight has a similar purpose: to help fight the Infection spreading through Hallownest.

Old syringes like this one didn’t have needles. They used plungers to push medicine through reed-like tubes. Hornet’s weapon also behaves like this—she sends out thread from her needle, not as a projectile, but directly from the tool itself. This similarity suggests that her design may have been inspired by medical syringes.

These syringes were used for a very painful treatment called urethral irrigation, where infected areas were flushed with mercury. Hornet’s role in Hollow Knight mirrors this harsh cure. During the final battle, she helps the Knight get inside the Hollow Knight’s mind to destroy the Radiance, the source of the Infection. Unlike real syringes, her needle uses thread—possibly made by Hornet herself, as a gift from her spider-queen mother, Herrah.
