    This hive uses stackable wooden boxes so bees can live and work naturally. In Hollow Knight, The Hive has a similar shape, with layers of wood forming a busy and organized world.

    Abbé Warré’s “People’s Hive” is designed with wooden boxes that bees can use to build their combs without disturbance. It’s simple and helps the bees grow in a healthy way. In Hollow Knight, The Hive is filled with wooden chairs and shelves stacked in similar patterns. These layered designs in both the real world and the game show how natural shapes and repeated forms can support strong, active communities.

    The “People’s Hive” was made by Abbé Warré to give bees a safe, natural place to grow. It uses stacked wooden boxes that make it easy for bees to build and stay healthy. The idea is to work with nature, not against it. Hollow Knight’s Hive shows this same thinking. It’s filled with layered wooden furniture and structures that repeat, just like the boxes in Warré’s hive. These shapes feel both planned and natural, showing how real bees—and fictional ones—can live in places that are simple, smart, and made for cooperation. Both Warrè’s hive and Hollownest’s The Hive are quiet examples of how community and design can come together.
