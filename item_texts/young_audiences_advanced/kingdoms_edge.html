    This half-skull, half-face sculpture shows how life and death are connected. In Hollow Knight, the Pale King’s change and the piles of bones near the Colosseum of Fools show that even great things fade with time.

    A memento mori like this—showing a face split between life and death—is meant to help people remember that all things come to an end. In Hollow Knight, this idea shows up in Kingdom’s Edge. The Pale King gives up his huge Wyrm form and becomes something smaller. Around the Colosseum of Fools, broken bodies turn to bones and are left behind. Like this sculpture, these places show us how time changes everything—and that memory, identity, and form don’t always stay the same.

    This artwork, called a memento mori, shows a woman whose face is part human and part skull. It’s meant to make us think about life, death, and the moment when one becomes the other. In Hollow Knight, the same theme appears in Kingdom’s Edge. There, the Colosseum of Fools throws fallen warriors into a pit, where their bones pile up in silence. The Pale King, once a giant Wyrm, gives up his shape to become something more human—but also more fragile. This change is both powerful and sad, just like the woman’s split face in the sculpture. Both the artwork and the game ask us big questions: What happens when we change? What parts of us stay the same? And what gets left behind?
