    This Japanese scroll tells a dreamlike story through pictures. In Hollow Knight, the Archive where Monomon sleeps feels the same—silent, mysterious, and full of knowledge waiting to be discovered.

    A Wakeful Sleep is a Japanese scroll made to be unrolled slowly, showing a soft, dreamy story about thoughts and feelings. In Hollow Knight, the Teacher’s Archive is also a quiet place where Monomon floats in water, as if in a dream. Both the scroll and the Archive hold memories that need to be explored and understood carefully, like reading between the lines of a story.

    This scroll from 15th-century Japan was made by an artist named Tosa Mitsunobu. It shows a story that feels like a dream, with gentle brushstrokes and quiet scenes. These handscrolls were special—they were rolled up and kept safe until someone slowly unrolled them to see the tale inside. In Hollow Knight, Monomon the Teacher is kept in a tank inside the Teacher’s Archive, in a foggy area called Fog Canyon. She looks peaceful, but she holds important knowledge about the kingdom. The scroll and the Archive are both slow, thoughtful spaces that ask the reader—or the player—to look deeper. Each one reveals its story a little at a time, like waking from a long dream.
