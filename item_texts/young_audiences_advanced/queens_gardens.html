Henry E. Sharp’s stained-glass window “Faith and Hope” comes from a church in New York and shows two symbolic figures. The tall, colourful windows have a Gothic Revival style that’s also used in Hollow Knight’s Queen’s Gardens, giving the area a royal and peaceful feeling.

In Sharp’s stained-glass design, Faith and Hope stand under trefoil arches (a shape with three rounded points), and are surrounded by bright reds, blues, and yellows. These windows are full of tiny details and are based on designs from the Middle Ages. In Hollow Knight, the Queen’s Gardens use a similar style—pointed arches, curving window frames, and clever uses of light—to make the area feel special and elegant, though the style leans more toward nature than the other parts of Hallownest.

Around the 1850s, many churches were built in New York, and artists like Sharp helped decorate them with stained-glass windows like “Faith and Hope.” These windows were bright, detailed, and full of meaning. In Hollow Knight, the Queen’s Gardens show a similar feeling, where old beauty still shines through. The Gardens used to be a quiet place for the Queen of Hallownest, and now, even though it’s full of vines and ruin, the windows and design still tell a story. They show a mix of beauty and sadness, reminding players of what once was.
