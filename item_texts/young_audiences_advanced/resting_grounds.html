Paul Klee’s Ships in the Dark shows boats floating in the air like they’re dreaming, lost in a dark sky. In Hollow Knight, the same dreamlike feeling appears when the Knight gets the Dream Nail and begins exploring the Resting Grounds. Both the painting and the game leave things open to the viewer’s imagination.

The painting shows ships flying through the air, repeated again and again, each one a bit different in shape, size, or colour. We don’t know exactly what the boats are looking for—just like how the Knight doesn’t really know what they’re searching for at first. In the Resting Grounds, dreams and reality start to blend. The Dream Nail lets the Knight hear thoughts and see memories, turning the journey into something strange and dreamlike.

Klee’s painting feels calm but sad, with lonely ships drifting through space. The Resting Grounds in Hollow Knight feel the same way—with quiet ruins, soft music, and no enemies. Both use repetition to create emotion: the painting uses many boats, while the game repeats dreams and Essence as symbols. These help build the mysterious mood. Instead of telling the player or viewer what to think, both the painting and the game let people come up with their own meaning. In Hollow Knight, this idea—of showing instead of telling—is an important part of how the game shares its story and feeling.
