This oak panel was made by Augustus Pugin, a famous designer from the 1800s who helped bring back Gothic style in England. His detailed, old-fashioned designs influenced how parts of the Royal Waterways look in Hollow Knight, especially the decorated surfaces.

Pugin created interiors for the Palace of Westminster, and this panel is one part of that work. It includes patterns from medieval times—like the folds of cloth and shapes found in church windows. The Royal Waterways in Hollow Knight use similar designs, like flower-petal shapes or bug parts, turned into patterns that repeat. The result feels both natural and designed, just like Pugin’s work.

Pugin believed in using real materials and clear, strong designs, which he thought were not just beautiful but meaningful. In Hollow Knight, the Royal Waterways have a Gothic feeling too, even though they are dark, ruined, and underground. Their stone walls and arching ceilings still follow the same ideas—repeating patterns, nature mixed with structure, and a feeling of old greatness. Like Pugin’s panel, they help tell the story of a once powerful kingdom that has fallen into decay but still shows signs of its majestic past.
