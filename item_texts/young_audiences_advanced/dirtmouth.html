    This well was built over 400 years ago in Italy. It has two spiral staircases so people and animals could go down and come back up without bumping into each other. In Hollow Knight, the Knight also enters a deep well in the quiet town of Dirtmouth. That’s where their big adventure into Hallownest begins.

    St. Patrick’s Well in Orvieto has a very special design: two spiral ramps, one going down and one going up. This helped people and mules carry water during dangerous times without crossing paths. In Hollow Knight, the Knight begins their quest by going down a silent well in Dirtmouth. That well leads to the underground world of Hallownest, filled with secrets and strange creatures. Both wells mark the start of something mysterious—and there’s no turning back.

    This is a drawing of St. Patrick’s Well, built in the 1500s in the town of Orvieto, Italy. It was made to help people get water during a war. To do that, the architect designed two spiral staircases—one to go down, one to come back up—so mules could carry water without crashing into each other. But the well also feels mysterious, almost magical, because of how deep and dark it goes. In Hollow Knight, the Knight finds a similar well in the town of Dirtmouth. By jumping in, they leave the peaceful surface behind and enter the forgotten kingdom of Hallownest. Just like St. Patrick’s Well led people into the depths for survival, the well in the game leads the Knight into a world full of ancient ruins, silence, and danger.
