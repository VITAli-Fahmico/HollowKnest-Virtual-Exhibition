This Roman marble column was made during the reign of Emperor Hadrian, around 117–138 CE. Its design—with carved leaves and spiral shapes—is similar to the ones seen in Hollow Knight’s Ancient Basin, where the architecture feels old, quiet, and powerful.

The top part of this Roman column mixes two styles: Ionic (with spiral shapes called volutes) and Corinthian (with leafy designs called acanthus fronds). The grooves running down the shaft make the column seem taller and more graceful. In Hollow Knight, the Ancient Basin’s stone pillars have a similar shape. Even though they are cracked and faded, they still feel impressive, echoing the design of real ancient ruins.

The Ancient Basin is one of the oldest areas in Hallownest and feels very different from the rest of the kingdom. It’s simpler, darker, and full of broken, but beautiful stonework. These pillars seem like a tribute to the past, much like the Roman column was part of a grand structure. In both cases, the columns aren’t just decorations—they represent lost power and memory. The strong yet elegant forms in Roman architecture are mirrored in Hollow Knight through the tall, narrow, weathered columns of the Ancient Basin, showing the beauty of ruins and the history they carry.
