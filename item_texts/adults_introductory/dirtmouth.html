    Built in the 1500s, St. Patrick’s Well used a spiral design to allow safe access to water during a siege. In Hollow Knight, a similar well marks the start of a journey into a hidden kingdom—both wells guiding a descent into silence and mystery.

    St. Patrick’s Well in Orvieto was designed in the 16th century to provide secure access to water during times of siege. It features two separate spiral staircases—one going down, one going up—so mules could carry water without crossing paths. In the game Hollow Knight, a similar well appears in the quiet town of Dirtmouth. The player’s character enters it at the start of their journey, leaving the surface behind to explore a forgotten underground kingdom. Both wells act as gateways, leading into deeper, hidden worlds.

    This is an architectural drawing of St. Patrick’s Well in Orvieto, Italy, designed in the 1500s by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. Its unique spiral structure was built during a time of political uncertainty, meant to provide continuous access to water during a siege. The well features two separate staircases—one for descending and one for ascending—so that mules carrying water wouldn’t collide. Beyond its practical function, the well’s spiraling design and depth give it a mysterious, almost symbolic quality. A similar moment appears in the video game Hollow Knight, when the player’s character — the Knight — descends into a quiet, abandoned well at the edge of a forgotten town. This marks the beginning of their journey into a vast underground kingdom called Hallownest. Just like the historical well, this fictional one represents a point of no return, where the descent leads to silence, secrets, and the unknown.
