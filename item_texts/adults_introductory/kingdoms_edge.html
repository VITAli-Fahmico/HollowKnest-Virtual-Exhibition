    This artwork shows a woman’s face half alive and half a skull. In Hollow Knight, the Pale King and the warriors outside the Colosseum of Fools remind us that everything changes—even great rulers and brave fighters eventually fall to time.

    This memento mori—a reminder of death—shows a split image: one half of a woman’s face is alive, the other a skull. It invites viewers to reflect on life’s fragility. In Hollow Knight, these same ideas appear in Kingdom’s Edge, where the Pale King leaves behind his powerful Wyrm body and becomes something small and vulnerable. Near the Colosseum of Fools, fallen warriors turn to bones, just like the figure in this image. Both the artwork and the game ask us to think about how identity shifts with time, memory, and decay.

    This object is a memento mori—a work of art designed to remind us that life is short and death comes to all. The image is haunting: a woman shown half in life, half in death, with one side of her face still human and the other just bone. In Hollow Knight, the themes of transformation and impermanence are explored in similar ways. The Pale King begins as an ancient Wyrm, a powerful creature, but gives up his form to become something mortal—and much smaller. In Kingdom’s Edge, bones lie outside the Colosseum of Fools, where fallen fighters are discarded. Just like the figure in this artwork, they are caught between memory and forgetting. Both ask us to think about what remains after we change—or after we’re gone.
