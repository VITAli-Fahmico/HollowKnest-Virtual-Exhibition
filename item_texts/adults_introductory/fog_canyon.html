    This Japanese handscroll tells a story that feels like a dream. Its quiet scenes and soft colors reflect how fragile and mysterious memory can be. In Hollow Knight, Monomon’s resting place in the Teacher’s Archive feels similar—quiet, hidden, and full of meaning waiting to be discovered.

    A handscroll like A Wakeful Sleep from 15th-century Japan presents its story slowly, as viewers unroll it section by section. Its gentle colors and flowing images blur the line between dream and reality. These scrolls were often stored carefully to protect their delicate surface. In Hollow Knight, the Teacher’s Archive in Fog Canyon works the same way: it holds Monomon the Teacher, a preserved figure whose mind contains hidden truths. Like reading a scroll, the Knight must explore slowly, revealing secrets one piece at a time.

    A Wakeful Sleep is a Japanese handscroll from the 1400s that unfolds a dreamy, poetic story through soft brushstrokes and delicate lines. Handscrolls like this were treasured objects, protected in special boxes and viewed gradually, allowing the story to be revealed little by little. The atmosphere is calm and mysterious, blending the real and the unreal. In Hollow Knight, this idea is reflected in the Teacher’s Archive—a watery chamber that keeps Monomon the Teacher sealed in a tank of liquid memory. The space feels like a dream in itself: quiet, strange, and full of past knowledge. Just as the handscroll asks the viewer to uncover meaning one section at a time, the Archive invites the player to explore, interpret, and understand—gently unfolding the forgotten stories of Hallownest.
