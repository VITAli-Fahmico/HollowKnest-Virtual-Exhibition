“Faith and Hope” is a stained-glass double lancet window by Henry E. Sharp, originally made for St. Ann’s Church in Brooklyn, New York, USA. It exemplifies the Gothic Revival style with its symbolic figures and ornate coloured glass—an aesthetic mirrored in the architectural detailing of Hollow Knight’s Queen’s Gardens as seen in the featured images.

Sharp’s window features personifications of Faith and Hope, each framed beneath a trefoil arch and surrounded by vibrant red, blue, and yellow glass. The work reflects medieval church window styles with its pointed arches, ornate canopies, and sophisticated craftsmanship. The Queen’s Gardens incorporate similar Gothic Revival elements, including but not limited to framed openings, tracery, and stylised use of light—not through direct religious imagery, but in formal and structural design that evokes a sense of refined decay and lingering beauty.

The mid-19th century saw a boom in church construction across New York, especially around Broadway (the primary commercial district in Manhattan), which helped establish a stained-glass industry in the city. Sharp contributed to this movement by designing windows like “Faith and Hope” for major Gothic Revival churches. In Hollow Knight, the Queen’s Gardens similarly express an evolving neo-Gothic aesthetic. The area’s story is told through its decaying architecture and overgrown greenhouses—once an elegant retreat for Hallownest’s queen, now in ruins. The use of stained-glass-like forms and structural Gothic details ties directly to designs like Sharp’s, reinforcing the Gardens’ status as both an area of former grace and storytelling as seen through the environment.
