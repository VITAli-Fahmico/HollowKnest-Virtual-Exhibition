This accordion, built by Giovanni Marcosignori, was the first to feature a celluloid exterior and remains one of the most valuable pieces in the Museo Della Fisarmonica. Its refined, vintage design helped inspire Brumm’s accordion in Hollow Knight, whose music is heard after lighting the Nightmare Lantern in the Howling Cliffs.

Gervasio Marcosignori, Giovanni’s son, began studying the accordion at a young age under his father’s guidance. Their legacy is preserved in the Museo Della Fisarmonica, with Giovanni remembered as a pioneer of modern accordion craftsmanship and Gervasio as a groundbreaking performer. Brumm’s music in Hollow Knight features the vintage sound of early 20th-century Italian accordions, with a theatrical, eerie tone, suitable for the mysterious Grimm Troupe. The design of Brumm’s accordion, with its celluloid-like texture and insect-like limbs, mirrors the unsettling hybrid nature of the troupe itself.

The celluloid accordion also reflects the broader legacy of Gervasio Marcosignori, who dedicated his life to performing and spreading accordion music, including arrangements of classical and modern works by composers like Bach and Gershwin. He was awarded the “Oscar Mondiale della Fisarmonica” for his efforts. Brumm’s music in Hollow Knight mirrors this legacy through its resemblance to Troupe Master Grimm’s theme, yet it contrasts greatly to the game's predominantly ambient and orchestral soundscape. The moment in the Howling Cliffs—where the Knight decides whether to invite the Grimm Troupe—marks the introduction of this distinct musical voice; hence, it is here that Brumm’s accordion and music are introduced.
