    This shawl was woven from the silk of over a million golden orb-weaver spiders. Like the strange silk-wrapped objects in Hollow Knight’s Deepnest, it shows how thread can be used to protect, preserve, and even trap what’s most valuable.

    Made from golden orb-weaver spider silk, this rare shawl was created using threads drawn and wrapped around small tools before weaving. The coiled silk calls to mind the eerie spoon-like forms wrapped in thread throughout Hollow Knight’s Deepnest, especially in the quiet, unsettling Distant Village. Both the shawl and the in-game objects feel like offerings or protective bundles—symbols of how silk can hold memory, care, and hidden meaning.

    This handwoven shawl, created using silk from more than a million golden orb-weaver spiders, is both a technical marvel and a fragile work of preservation. The silk was gathered without harming the spiders and carefully wrapped around small tools in spirals to store the threads before weaving. In Hollow Knight, Deepnest is a dark, tangled area filled with silk-covered shapes—especially in Distant Village, where strange cocooned forms (resembling the spiral tools introduced before) line the walls like sacred objects. Herrah the Beast, one of the Dreamers, sleeps there—encased in thread, sealed in time. Like the shawl, Deepnest’s silken relics suggest protection, sacrifice, and the delicate tension between beauty and entrapment.
