    This badge was worn by pilgrims—travelers who completed a sacred journey. In the video game Hollow Knight, the main character enters a place called the Forgotten Crossroads, where worn statues and an archway called the Pilgrim’s Gate mark the start of a mysterious path. Both badge and gate represent quiet journeys filled with meaning, even when that meaning has been forgotten.

    In medieval times, people who traveled to sacred places often wore small metal badges like this one to show they had completed their journey. These objects were symbols of faith and personal accomplishment. In Hollow Knight, a video game set in a mysterious underground world, there is a place called the Forgotten Crossroads where a gate called the Pilgrim’s Way appears. Its shape looks like this badge, and it too marks the beginning of a long and meaningful journey. Though the world in the game is fictional, it reflects the same themes of travel, memory, and spiritual discovery.

    This small metal badge comes from the Middle Ages and was once worn by someone who completed a sacred journey, known as a pilgrimage. These badges were often mass-produced and pinned to clothes or hats as signs of faith and proof of travel. They told others that the wearer had been to a holy place and made a meaningful personal journey. In Hollow Knight, a beautifully crafted video game about exploring a ruined insect kingdom, there’s a place called the Forgotten Crossroads—an area filled with quiet ruins and fading religious imagery. One of the first structures the player encounters is the Pilgrim’s Gate, a tall stone archway that looks like this badge. The Knight’s journey through this world follows the same ideas found in historical pilgrimages: silent movement through sacred places, signs of belief left behind, and a search for something greater—perhaps healing, perhaps memory. Though the game is fictional, its world is full of symbols that reflect real history.
