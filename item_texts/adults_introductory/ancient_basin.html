This ancient Roman marble column, dating from 117–138 CE during the Hadrianic period, exemplifies Roman architectural sophistication. Its grooved shaft and decorative capital recall the monumental structures echoed in Hollow Knight’s Ancient Basin, which is an area that has many old structures and roads that draw from ancient Roman and Greek aesthetics.

The capital of this column belongs to the Roman composite order, blending Ionic volutes with Corinthian acanthus fronds (the leafy decorations) are below. The vertical fluting on the shaft elongates the form and contributes to its visual elegance. Though partially restored, the aged nature of the column is still very evident, just like the cracked, slender pillars of the Ancient Basin. These worn surfaces suggest that Hallownest’s underground city draws from classical Roman and Greek aesthetics, with clear evidence of the lasting qualities of their monumental architecture.

The Ancient Basin, one of the deepest and oldest regions in Hollow Knight, is marked by a shift toward stripped-back, monumental design. Its stark stone structures and minimalist geometry stand in contrast to the more organic designs elsewhere in the game. This architectural transition mirrors the Roman ideal of strength fused with elegance—something seen in this particular Hadrianic column and echoed in the game’s towering, worn away pillars. These columns, weathered but dignified, help define the Basin as a ruined tribute to a once-great civilisation, reinforcing the Gothic melancholy and grandiosity that are central to Hallownest’s worldbuilding.
