    This natural beehive design uses stackable wooden boxes so bees can build freely. In Hollow Knight, The Hive uses a similar layered structure—showing how nature and design can work together in both real and imagined worlds.

    Abbé Warré’s “People’s Hive” is a beehive built with stackable wooden boxes, letting bees create honeycombs naturally without too much human interference. In Hollow Knight, The Hive is designed in a similar way—with repeated layers of shelves and chairs that feel both organic and organized. Both structures show how spaces can be built to support life through simple, repeating forms.

    Abbé Warré’s “People’s Hive” is a special kind of beehive built to let bees live and build naturally. Made of stacked wooden boxes, it allows bees to create their combs without being disturbed. This simple but thoughtful design reflects an interest in harmony with nature. In Hollow Knight, The Hive is made of similar repeating layers—wooden chairs, bookshelves, and tunnels that rise like honeycomb. Even though it’s fictional, it captures the same feeling: a place that is both structured and alive. Like Warré’s hive, it reminds us that living communities often grow best when we let them build in their own way.
