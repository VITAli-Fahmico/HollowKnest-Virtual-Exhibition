This 16th-century syringe, recovered from the Mary Rose, was used to treat infections of patients onboard. In Hollow Knight, Hornet’s needle, first encountered in Greenpath, plays a similarly vital role in confronting and curing Hallownest’s spreading Infection.

Unlike modern syringes, these early tools worked without needles. They used plungers to apply medicine through reed-like tubes—designs that are similar to the structure and motion of Hornet’s needle. Her thread emerges from within the tool, not fired outward, but pushed as if it were the medicine itself. This is evident given the motion shown by Hornet’s needle when she casts/pushes out the thread inside onto an enemy without any projectile shown besides the actual content inside the needle (i.e. the string in this case).

The syringe was used to flush infections from the body with harsh substances like mercury—a painful but common remedy for diseases like gonorrhoea and syphilis. This brutal cleansing process is akin to Hornet’s role in the final boss battle, where she gives the Knight the chance to access the source of the Infection, the Radiance. Rather than chemical treatment, Hornet uses her thread—potentially spun from her own being, thanks to powers inherited from her mother Herrah (the queen of the spiders).
