The steam-powered elevator in the house of Guard Captain S. Muyaki in St. Petersburg, Russia was designed to deliver residents directly to their apartment rooms.  In a similar way, there is an ornate elevator that seamlessly takes the Knight between the wealthy side of the City of Tears and the Forgotten Crossroads.

Muyaki’s elevator is a clear example of early Art Nouveau aesthetics fused with industrial design. Built in the early 1900s, it features luxurious woods, visible mechanical parts, and detailed craftsmanship. This combination represents the steampunk style, which blends Victorian elegance with old mechanics. Both elevators—Muyaki’s and the Knight’s—display wrought iron designs, domed ceilings, and finely decorated interiors. While the elevator in Muyaki’s residence serves few people today, the Knight alone travels this symbolic passage between Hallownest’s decadent elegance and its forgotten depths.

These elevators are not merely functional—they serve as status markers and spatial transitions. Muyaki’s is rarely used today, preserved for annual tests, emblematic of a once-existing age of elite living. The Knight’s lift feels similarly sacred, a near-ritual pathway that links the grandeur of the capital with Forgotten Crossroads. Both elevators serve as portals in more than a physical sense: they invite reflection on how architecture and movement once shaped identity, social order, and the values of the environments they belonged to. In both cases, they stand as reminders of a time when vertical movement mirrored social hierarchy and space was indicative of power and decay.
