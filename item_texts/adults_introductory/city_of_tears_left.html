This Parisian balcony front, created around 1900, features curling tendrils and vegetal scrolls, resembling the design motifs seen in Hollow Knight, particularly as the Knight walks through the City of Tears. These ornate structures reflect the Art Nouveau movement from France, which have served as an important basis for the game’s aesthetic.

This piece is one of many iconic works by designer and architect Hector Guimard, a leading figure in the Art Nouveau movement. Inspired by Victor Horta—an early pioneer of the style—Guimard embraced the organic curves and stylised plant forms that defined Art Nouveau. These influences are evident in Hollow Knight, where Team Cherry’s designers have clearly drawn from Guimard’s visual language, not only in the City of Tears, but across much of Hallownest.

Guimard’s legacy includes the Castel Beranger and the famous Paris Metro entrances, but his influence also extended to interior design and future-oriented fittings. These elements likely informed the architecture of the City of Tears—not only in this balcony’s elegant design but in the game’s buildings, interiors, and other large spaces. Notably, the Stag Station at the City Storerooms strongly resembles the metro station at Porte Dauphine, with entrances styled in a similar way in combination with balcony-like features. Details such as wallpaper, curtains, and perfume bottle-shaped objects together produce a Baudelairian mood, which perfectly suits the idea of Hallownest being a faded kingdom from a long time ago.
