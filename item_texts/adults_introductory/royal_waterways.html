This carved oak panel represents the work of Augustus Pugin, the foremost figure in England’s Gothic Revival movement. His work is central to the transformation in British design that commenced in the mid-nineteenth century. His influence is visible throughout the Royal Waterways in Hollow Knight, where ornamental surfaces such as floors and ceilings reflect similar styles.

This panel was one component of Pugin’s elaborate decorative interior program for the Palace of Westminster. Drawing on medieval tracery and linenfold patterns, it reflects Pugin’s unique Gothic Revival vision. The Royal Waterways borrow heavily from this aesthetic: the ornamental surface design includes mirrored forms that resemble petals or mandibles, stylised to show both organic shapes and structured decoration. In Pugin’s panel, nature is transformed into structured, architectural beauty.

The panel reflects the core values of the Gothic Revival: moral clarity, honest materiality, and admiration for medieval craftsmanship. Pugin’s philosophy tied visual beauty to moral truth. In Hollow Knight, the Royal Waterways very much echo this vision, though in a ruined, subterranean context. Repeated motifs in stone, gridded floors, and vaulted ceilings preserve a sense of structured grandeur now tainted by decay and infestation. Like Pugin’s panel, the Waterways show a civilisation that once used ornamentation and a sense of order  to reflect purpose and identity—an aesthetic of beauty and meaning now lost, yet still present in an eerie manner.
