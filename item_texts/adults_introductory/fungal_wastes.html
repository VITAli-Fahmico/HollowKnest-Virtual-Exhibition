    This Japanese Noh mask shows different emotions depending on where you’re standing. In Hollow Knight, mounted beast heads in the Fungal Wastes give a similar feeling—unmoving yet strangely alive. Both the mask and the game’s heads suggest shifting identities and hidden emotions beneath the surface.

    Noh masks are used in traditional Japanese theater to show emotion in subtle, shifting ways. Depending on the angle and lighting, the mask may look happy, sad, or angry—all without changing expression. In Hollow Knight, the Fungal Wastes feature heads of strange creatures mounted on poles. Though still, they seem to watch and react, their mood uncertain. These unsettling faces mirror the Noh mask’s mystery, capturing the game’s themes of memory, decay, and emotional transformation.

    This Japanese Noh mask was used in a traditional form of theater known for its rich symbolism and minimal movement. The mask’s expression seems to change based on how it’s lit or where the viewer stands—an effect that brings the character to life without motion. In Hollow Knight, the player encounters a similar effect in the Fungal Wastes, a strange and decaying area filled with the heads of beasts mounted on poles. These heads seem to shift in mood, silently watching the Knight pass by. Though entirely still, they suggest emotional depth and haunting presence. Like the Noh mask, they explore ideas of identity, memory, and transformation—how something can appear simple on the outside but hold deeper meaning within.
