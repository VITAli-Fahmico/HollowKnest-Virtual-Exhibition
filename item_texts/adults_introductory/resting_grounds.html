Paul Klee’s Ships in the Dark presents abstract, dreamlike boats drifting in a dark sky, evoking a sense of aimless searching. This atmosphere strongly parallels the mood of Hollow Knight once the Knight acquires the Dream Nail in the Resting Grounds, where the Knight’s reality and their dreams begin to blur distinctions between reality and the dream world of Hallownest.

Klee’s painting offers no clear narrative or purpose for the ships—it invites symbolic reading without specific answers. The boats seem to be seeking something unknown, much like the Knight’s ambiguous quest to understand the Infection and themselves. The Resting Grounds shares the tone of Ships in the Dark through its hushed, empty spaces and soft music. Both use quietness and ambiguity to evoke reflection and a sense of sadness.

A key surrealist technique found in both the painting and the game is repetition. Klee repeats ships with small differences—highlighting contrast in colour, shape, and size. This similarly echoes how Hollow Knight deals with the concept of dreams in  the Resting Grounds: through a slow descent, the collection of Essence, and the persistent presence of dream-related visuals. The game’s aesthetic doesn’t specifically dictate meaning but invites interpretation. The presentation of recurring, slightly altered motifs such as ships or dreams emphasises mood over clarity. This contributes to Team Cherry’s commitment to building a strong atmosphere in Hallownest, letting the game thrive on uncertainty and poetic imagery.
