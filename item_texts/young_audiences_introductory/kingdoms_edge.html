    This face is half alive and half a skull. In Hollow Knight, you see something similar in Kingdom’s Edge—bones and broken bodies show how everything, even heroes, can change or disappear.

    This artwork shows a woman’s face divided between life and death—one side looks normal, the other is a skull. It reminds people that nothing lasts forever. In Hollow Knight, Kingdom’s Edge has piles of bones outside the Colosseum of Fools, where fallen warriors are thrown away. Even the Pale King, once powerful, changes his shape and becomes weaker. Both the artwork and the game show how life, death, and memory are all connected.

    This memento mori shows a woman’s face that is part living person and part skeleton. “Memento mori” means “remember you must die,” and this image reminds us that life doesn’t last forever. In Hollow Knight, the same idea appears in Kingdom’s Edge. Warriors who lose in the Colosseum of Fools are tossed outside, and their bones stay behind. The Pale King, a great ruler, also changes—he gives up his huge Wyrm body and becomes smaller, more like everyone else. Like the woman in the image, he’s caught between what he was and what he became. Both the real-world object and the game help us think about what happens to people—and their memories—after they change or pass away.
