Paul Klee’s painting Ships in the Dark shows strange-looking boats flying through a dark sky. They seem lost, floating quietly, just like the Knight in Hollow Knight when they get the Dream Nail and begin seeing into dreams. Both the painting and the game feel mysterious, like being inside a dream where nothing is fully explained.

In Klee’s painting, the flying boats are repeated many times. They’re all different in size, shape, and colour, and they seem to be searching for something, but we don’t know what. This reminds us of the Knight, who travels through Hallownest trying to understand the Infection and find their true purpose. When the Dream Nail is found in the Resting Grounds, it lets the Knight read the minds of others, mixing dreams and reality in a strange and magical way.

Just like the quiet feeling in Klee’s painting, the Resting Grounds in Hollow Knight also feel lonely and peaceful, with gentle music and very few creatures. Both the game and the painting repeat certain images—like boats in the sky or dreams and Essence in the game—to make us feel a certain way. These repeated symbols help tell a story without using words. In Hollow Knight, this dreamlike style makes players think about what they see, instead of giving them clear answers. That’s a big part of what makes the game feel so mysterious and beautiful.
