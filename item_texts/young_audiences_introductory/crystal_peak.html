This carved stone comes from ancient Egypt during a time called the Byzantine period. It shows a special vine design, called a rinceau, which looks like curling plants. These shapes are also seen in Hollow Knight, especially in Crystal Peak, where even small things like lanterns show this type of pattern.

The rinceau pattern is made of curved plant vines, and it was popular in places like the eastern Mediterranean since Roman times. Sometimes animals were added, like wolves or gazelles. In Hollow Knight, Crystal Peak has carvings like this, with bug-shaped figures and even machines like ore conveyor belts that use this vine style to tell the story of the area. You can also spot this kind of decoration in the way the game introduces new places to the Knight.

These rinceau patterns didn’t just appear on single objects—they were used in big buildings from the Roman, Romanesque, and Renaissance times. Later, in the 1600s and 1700s, the design came back in a simpler way, without repeating the same shapes exactly. This is like what you see in Hollow Knight, where the rinceau in palaces and railings twist and turn freely instead of following perfect patterns. This wavy, flowing style adds a magical feeling to the game and helps build the dreamy atmosphere of Hallownest.
