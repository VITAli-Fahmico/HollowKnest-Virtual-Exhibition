    This Japanese scroll shows a dreamlike story with soft colors and gentle pictures. In Hollow Knight, the Archive where Monomon rests feels just like that—quiet, strange, and full of secrets waiting to be found.

    Long ago in Japan, artists painted stories on handscrolls that were slowly unrolled to reveal each part of the tale. A Wakeful Sleep is one of these scrolls. Its images look soft and dreamy, like something from a memory. In Hollow Knight, the Teacher’s Archive works in a similar way. Monomon lies inside, holding knowledge that must be uncovered slowly. Both the scroll and the Archive hide important stories—and you have to look closely to understand them.

    A Wakeful Sleep is a special Japanese handscroll that tells its story one section at a time as you slowly unroll it. The paintings feel dreamy and mysterious. These scrolls were kept safe in special boxes, only shown on rare occasions. In Hollow Knight, Monomon the Teacher is kept in a quiet place called the Archive, floating inside a glass tank. It’s peaceful, but also strange—like being inside a dream. The scroll and the Archive both hold memories and ideas that take time to see and understand. Just like the Knight, you must go slowly and carefully to discover what’s hidden inside.
