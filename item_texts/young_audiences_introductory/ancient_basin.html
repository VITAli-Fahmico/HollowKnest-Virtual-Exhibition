This tall marble column comes from Ancient Rome and was made almost 2,000 years ago. It has fancy carvings and was built during the time of Emperor Hadrian. In Hollow Knight, you can find similar tall, old columns in the Ancient Basin, which feels like a forgotten part of Hallownest.

The top of the Roman column has a special design with curls (called volutes) and leafy shapes (called acanthus fronds). These decorations come from two different Roman and Greek styles and were made to look elegant and tall. In Hollow Knight, the Ancient Basin has stone columns that also look tall and carved. Even though they are cracked and worn, they still look fancy and old, just like the Roman ones.

The Ancient Basin is one of the oldest places in Hallownest. It feels very still and quiet, like a place from long ago. Its stone pillars and simple buildings are very different from other places in the game. These columns make the place feel important, like it was once used to honour the Pale King. Just like the Roman column, they show how something strong and elegant can last a long timeâ€”even when broken. The Roman column and the Ancient Basin both use the same idea: to build something that shows power, beauty, and memory.
