This is a special accordion made by Giovanni Marcosignori. It was the first one to be covered in shiny plastic called celluloid. This beautiful and old-fashioned design inspired the accordion in Hollow Knight, which you hear when the Knight lights the Nightmare Lantern in the Howling Cliffs.

Giovanni’s son, Gervasio, learned to play the accordion from his father when he was very young. Today, both of them are remembered in a museum called the Museo Della Fisarmonica. The music played by Brumm’s accordion in Hollow Knight sounds old, spooky, and a little like a carnival. It matches the strange, mysterious feeling of the Grimm Troupe. Brumm’s accordion even looks like a bug with legs, which makes it feel both alive and creepy—just like the music.

The celluloid design of the accordion shows how much Gervasio Marcosignori loved and worked with the instrument. He won a big award for his music and helped make the accordion popular all over the world. In Hollow Knight, the Knight has to decide whether or not to let the Grimm Troupe into Hallownest, and this is when Brumm’s strange music starts to play. It sounds very different from the usual music in the game and reminds us of Gervasio’s exciting and theatrical style. The accordion, both in real life and in the game, tells an important story through music.
