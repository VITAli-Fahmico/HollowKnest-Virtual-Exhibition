“Faith and Hope” is a stained-glass window made by an artist named Henry E. Sharp. It came from a church in New York and shows two people—Faith and Hope—who each stand in a tall, colourful window. In Hollow Knight, the windows in the Queen’s Gardens look a lot like this one, helping make the area feel grand and special.

Sharp’s window uses shapes and colours from a style called Gothic Revival. The people in the window stand under fancy arches with strong red, blue, and yellow colours all around them. In Hollow Knight, the Queen’s Gardens have big windows with shapes like these—pointy arches, twisty patterns, and bright light—though their style feels more nature-filled than other areas. These windows help make the Queen’s Gardens look elegant, even if the place is old and overgrown.

In the 1850s, many churches were built in New York, so stained-glass artists like Sharp had lots of work. He made “Faith and Hope” and other windows for St. Ann’s Church. These beautiful windows helped tell stories through colour and light. In Hollow Knight, the Queen’s Gardens also tell a story—but through the buildings, plants, and windows left behind. The area used to be a peaceful garden for the Queen of Hallownest, and even though it’s now full of vines and thorns, the fancy windows still shine, showing that something beautiful once lived there.
