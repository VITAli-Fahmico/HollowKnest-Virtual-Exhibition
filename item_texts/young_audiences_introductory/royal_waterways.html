This carved wooden panel was designed by Augustus Pugin, who helped bring back the old-fashioned Gothic style in 1800s England. In Hollow Knight, you can see similar patterns and shapes in the Royal Waterways, especially on the floors, walls, and ceilings.

This panel is made from oak wood and was part of a bigger decoration project for the Palace of Westminster in London. Pugin’s style used shapes from the Middle Ages, like folded cloth and pointy window patterns. In Hollow Knight, the Royal Waterways have patterns that look like petals or bug mandibles, just like the designs on this panel. These shapes make the place feel both natural and fancy at the same time.

Pugin believed that good design should be honest and meaningful. He thought that the materials used and the patterns chosen should be beautiful but also moral. In Hollow Knight, the Royal Waterways reflect this Gothic style too—but in a darker and broken way. You can still see beautiful designs, like fancy carvings in stone and tall, curved ceilings, even though the place is now ruined. Like Pugin’s panel, the Waterways show how beauty and order once existed in Hallownest, but now feel mysterious and ancient, holding onto that special style from long ago.
