    This golden shawl was made from spider silk. In Hollow Knight, the webs in Deepnest feel just like it—full of strange shapes and sleeping secrets, all wrapped in thread.

    This shawl is made from the silk of golden spiders—over a million of them! The silk was gently taken and wrapped on little tools before being woven. In Hollow Knight, the Deepnest area is full of creepy shapes wrapped in spider silk too. Just like the shawl, the webs in the game seem to hide things—maybe treasures, maybe memories, or maybe something that should stay sleeping.

    This rare shawl was made using silk from more than a million golden orb-weaver spiders. The silk was gently pulled from the spiders and wrapped around small tools before weaving. The process was careful and slow, just like the way things are stored in Hollow Knight’s Deepnest. In the game, Deepnest is dark and full of spider webs. Some of them wrap around strange shapes—maybe spoons, maybe bodies, maybe something forgotten. One of the Dreamers, Herrah the Beast, is found there too, sleeping in her webbed chamber. Like the shawl, the silk in Deepnest isn’t just pretty—it’s a way to protect, hide, and hold onto something important.
