This old elevator from a house in St. Petersburg, Russia, was used to carry people straight to their apartment rooms. It looks very fancy and is kind of like the elevator in Hollow Knight that takes the Knight between the City of Tears and the Forgotten Crossroads.

The elevator was made in the early 1900s and mixes beautiful decorations with machine parts like gears and pipes. This mix is called steampunk—it’s a style that combines old-fashioned beauty with strong machines. Like in Hollow Knight, the elevator has pretty patterns, curved iron designs, and a round roof. Today, only a few people use Muyaki’s elevator, and in the game, the Knight is the only one who rides their elevator between the two very different places.

These elevators are more than just ways to get from one place to another. They show the importance of style and technology. Muyaki’s elevator is rarely used now—it only works during tests. The Knight’s elevator also feels special, like a secret passage through the ruins of a once-great kingdom. Both elevators take people between rich and poor areas, private and public spaces. They make us think about how moving through space can show who someone is, what their world was like, and how things have changed over time.
