This is a very old syringe from a ship called the Mary Rose, used to help sick people onboard. In Hollow Knight, Hornet uses a needle to protect Hallownest, just like doctors used syringes to fight infections.

Unlike today’s syringes, this one didn’t have a sharp needle. Instead, it worked like a little pump. Some syringes looked like reeds, much like Hornet’s needle, which shoots out a string instead of a sharp point. It shows that both are meant to push something out—medicine or thread.

This syringe was used by special people on the ship to clean out infections using strong liquids like mercury, which burned away diseases. In Hollow Knight, Hornet also helps fight the Infection in Hallownest. In the final battle, she helps the Knight reach the real cause of the sickness, the Radiance. Unlike burning liquids, Hornet’s power may come from her mother, Herrah, who gave her the gift of spinning magical thread.
