    Long ago, people who visited holy places got special badges to show they had made an important journey. In Hollow Knight, the hero walks through an old area called the Forgotten Crossroads, where a big stone gate marks the start of their path while the badge marked the end of a journey long ago.

    n the Middle Ages, people who traveled to special religious places were called pilgrims. When they finished their journey, they received a small badge to wear on their clothes. It showed they had done something important. In the game Hollow Knight, the Knight walks through a place filled with statues and signs of travelers from the past. There’s even a stone archway called the Pilgrim’s Way that looks like the badge! Both the badge and the gate show that someone is about to go on, or has already completed, a meaningful journey.

    Hundreds of years ago, people made long trips to holy places. These travelers were called pilgrims. When they finished their journey, they were given a small badge made of metal. They wore it proudly to show their faith and courage. In the video game Hollow Knight, the main character—the Knight—goes on a different kind of journey. They enter a place called the Forgotten Crossroads, where old statues and broken signs show that others once traveled there too. At the entrance stands a big stone arch called the Pilgrim’s Gate. It looks a lot like the real pilgrim badge. In both the game and real life, these objects are symbols of someone starting (or finishing) a brave and personal adventure.
