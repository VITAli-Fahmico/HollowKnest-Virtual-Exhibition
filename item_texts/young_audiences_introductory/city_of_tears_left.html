This is a fancy balcony front from Paris, made over 100 years ago. It’s covered in twisting shapes and leafy designs, just like the ones you can see when the Knight walks through the City of Tears in Hollow Knight. These patterns are part of an art style from France called Art Nouveau, which clearly inspired many things in the game.

The balcony was made by a famous artist and architect named Hector Guimard. He was one of the top creators of the Art Nouveau style. He learned a lot from another famous designer named Victor Horta, who liked to use plant shapes in his work. Guimard used similar curvy designs, and his work went on to inspire many other artists—including the creators of Hollow Knight. You can see the same elegant style all over the City of Tears, and even in other parts of Hallownest.

Some of Guimard’s most well-known works include the Castel Béranger and the special entrances to the Paris metro. He also designed lots of furniture and decorations for houses, and some of these may have inspired the look of the City of Tears. The simple, curved look of this balcony front appears in other areas too—like in the buildings, stations, and even in the City Storerooms where the Stag Station entrance looks like Guimard’s metro designs. Details like patterned curtains, soft lights, and perfume-bottle shapes all help create the dreamy, faded feeling of Hallownest—a once-beautiful kingdom that’s now just a memory.
