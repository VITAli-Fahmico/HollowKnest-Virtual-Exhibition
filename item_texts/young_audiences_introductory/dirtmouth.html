    This is a special well built in Italy a long time ago. It has two spiral staircases so people and animals could go down to get water and come back up without bumping into each other. In the video game Hollow Knight, the main character - the Knight - also goes down a quiet well to start exploring a strange underground world.

    St. Patrick’s Well was built over 400 years ago in a town in Italy. It was made during a time when people needed a safe way to get water, even if the town was under attack. The well has a smart design: two spiral ramps, one going down and one going up, so mules carrying water didn’t crash into each other. In the video game Hollow Knight, a small hero begins their journey by going down a quiet well into a dark, forgotten kingdom. Both wells lead into mysterious worlds hidden below.

    A long time ago, in a town in Italy called Orvieto, people built a very deep well to help them get water during times of war. It was called St. Patrick’s Well. To make it easier for animals to carry water, the builders made two spiral staircases—one going down, and one going up—so they wouldn’t run into each other. It was a smart and beautiful design. In a video game called Hollow Knight, the main character finds a quiet well in a small town. When they jump in, they leave the peaceful surface and enter a strange, underground world. Just like the real well helped people reach something important underground (water!), the game’s well takes the hero to the start of an exciting adventure.
