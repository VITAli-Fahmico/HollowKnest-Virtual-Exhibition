    This beehive is made from wooden boxes that stack like building blocks. In Hollow Knight, The Hive is made in the same way, using layers and shapes that help bees live and work together.

    The “People’s Hive” by Abbé Warré is built from wooden boxes that bees can live in and build inside without much help from people. It’s designed to be simple and natural. In Hollow Knight, The Hive has a similar look: it’s filled with rows of chairs and shelves stacked one above the other. Both real and imaginary hives show how things can be made to grow naturally, using repeating shapes and simple ideas.

    Abbé Warré created the “People’s Hive” as a natural home for bees. It’s built from wooden boxes that stack up, letting bees build their combs freely. This helps them stay healthy and work together. In Hollow Knight, The Hive also feels like a place made by and for its insect residents. Its rooms are stacked and layered—chairs on top of chairs, shelves that go up and up—just like the boxes in Warré’s design. Both the real hive and the game’s version show how creatures can build strong communities using simple shapes, smart design, and teamwork.
