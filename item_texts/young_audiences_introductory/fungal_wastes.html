    This is a Japanese theater mask. Its expression can look happy or sad depending on how you look at it. In Hollow Knight, there are big animal heads in the Fungal Wastes that also seem to change mood. Both are a little creepy—and a little mysterious.

    This mask comes from a kind of Japanese theater called Noh. It’s made so that the face looks different depending on where you’re standing—sometimes happy, sometimes sad, or even a little scary. In Hollow Knight, you can see strange animal heads on poles in the Fungal Wastes. They don’t move, but they seem to be watching you. Just like the mask, they feel like they’re hiding something. They make the game world feel full of secrets and forgotten stories.

    This is a mask from Noh, a traditional Japanese theater where actors use masks to show different emotions. What’s cool about it is that its expression can seem to change depending on how the light hits it or where you’re standing. It might look calm one moment, and then sad or even angry the next. In Hollow Knight, there’s a place called the Fungal Wastes where you see giant animal heads stuck on poles. They don’t move, but they seem like they’re watching you, and their faces feel like they change—just like the Noh mask. Both the mask and the heads make you wonder what happened in these places, adding mystery to the story.
